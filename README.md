<p class="introPara">In the event of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, or wildfires, it is crucial to have a rapid and efficient response system to ensure the safety of those affected. In the aftermath of natural disasters, there is often a shortage of trained NCC/NSS cadets who can provide immediate assistance to those affected. During natural disasters, it can be difficult to locate and reach people who need assistance, especially in remote or inaccessible areas. In many cases, natural disasters can cause significant damage to critical infrastructure, making it difficult to coordinate response efforts. To overcome these problems, this system will provide a reliable and centralized system for mobilizing ex-servicemen and trained NCC/NSS cadets to disaster sites, who are nearby the disaster site and reducing the reliance on centralized infrastructure.</p>
