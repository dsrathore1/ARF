# 🌟 Automated Response Force System - Backend 🌟

## Overview 📋
The backend of the Automated Response Force system serves as the core engine, handling data storage, retrieval, and processing. It manages communication with the frontend, coordinates response team mobilization, and facilitates resource allocation. The backend utilizes MongoDB for data management, integrates with NASA's REST API for geospatial data, and incorporates GeoLocation packages for location-based functionalities.

## Features 🚀
1. **Data Management**: Utilizes MongoDB for storing and retrieving data related to disaster sites, response teams, and allocated resources.
2. **Integration with NASA's API**: Integrates NASA's REST API to access geospatial data and satellite imagery for disaster site mapping and analysis.
3. **GeoLocation Package**: Incorporates a GeoLocation package for handling geographic coordinates, distance calculations, and location-based operations.
4. **Real-time Communication**: Facilitates real-time communication with the frontend for seamless interaction and updates.
5. **Resource Allocation Logic**: Implements algorithms for efficient resource allocation based on priority, need, and available resources.

## Technologies Used 💻
1. **Node.js**: Powers the backend server with JavaScript runtime for building scalable and efficient applications.
2. **Express.js**: Implements Express.js framework for building robust and flexible web applications and APIs.
3. **MongoDB**: Utilizes MongoDB as the database management system for storing and querying data.
4. **NASA's REST API**: Integrates NASA's REST API for accessing geospatial data and satellite imagery.
5. **GeoLocation Package**: Incorporates a GeoLocation package for handling geographic coordinates and location-based functionalities.
